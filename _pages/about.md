Hello!


I'm a Data Analyst with a background in operations, communication, and research. 

Before moving into Data Analytics, I spent most of my time optimizing workflows, contributing to project development, and researching EU policy regulations, particularly in the data privacy field. 

I hold a MS in Political Science from Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, where I studied European policies, inter-regional governance, and research methodologies. The studies sparked my interest in network analysis, natural language processing, and the dynamic world of data science.

Outside of research, I spend my time reading about psychology, animals, and permaculture.
