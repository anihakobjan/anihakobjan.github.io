Hello!

I'm a Data Analyst with great passion for multidisciplinary research.  

Previously, I contributed to project development and managed operations at DGD - the German Association for Data Protection. On the research side, I focused extensively on the GDPR, privacy rights, and EU policies. For exmaple, I developed online training courses on EU regulations designed for third-party organizations. Additionally, I have worked for five years in the private sector as a Communications Officer for CCCI, a Japanese service provider.

Outside of policy research, I am interested in natural language processing, network analysis, and AI safety.
